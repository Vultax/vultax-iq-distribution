# Vi IQ Evidence Handling Cases

Twelve **synthetic, authored examples** for checking whether an assistant or API consumer handles missing scores, stale sources and unversioned models honestly. These are not observed crypto data, a trading benchmark or evidence of model performance.

Each case combines a score being present/missing, its source being fresh/stale/unknown, and a producer version being present/missing. `EXAMPLEUSDT` is an invented instrument. All scores and dates are illustrative. Expected labels describe the evidence-handling rule, not an investment action.

## Use

Load `evidence-cases.jsonl` as JSON Lines. Ask the system under test to describe each record. Evaluate whether it preserves null, identifies stale/unknown freshness, and refrains from comparing scores across unverified producer versions. A second observation with the same version is still required for a real historical comparison.

`expected_may_compare_model_history` means the current record has a usable version and score; it does not establish that a second comparable record exists. Future work can add independently reviewed examples. This small deterministic fixture set is insufficient to establish general reliability.
